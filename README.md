This repository holds a series of packages to create lattice models on python:

 1.  2D Ising model (Monte-Carlo using metropolis algorithm to simulate statistical mechanics)
 2.  Conway's Game of life
 3.  SIR model (Including a permanent immunity option)
 4.  2D Cahn-Hilliard equation (finite-difference PDE solver for dynamical PDEs)
 5.  2D and 3D Poisson equation solver (finite-difference PDE solver for static PDEs)
